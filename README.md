# CsFairCarPoolApp

This is a mobile application I build for my final project in my highschool android app develupment class. The purpose of this application is to act as a uber for carpooling to school. Although this application was not feasible to launch I enjoyed building it and learing about the mobile firebase and google maps apis.
